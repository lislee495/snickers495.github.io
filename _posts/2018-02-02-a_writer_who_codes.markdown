## The Beginning 

For those who know me, my entrance into the world of coding is a shock. I spent the first fifteen years of my life wishing to be an artist, and the last seven wishing to be a writer. Briefly, I dipped into fantasies of working in medicine for the sake of posterity, but mainly I remained devoted to the arts. 

And for those who know me extremely well, they might know that the first class I've ever failed in was in my junior year of high school. The class? Computer science, of course. Two tests I flunked on, and I was only saved by desperate amounts of extra credit and a half-scrobbled game of chess that wasn't exactly functional. 

But the real truth is this: I got my first computer when I was five, and since that time, I never felt like this machine was ever beyond me. Throughout my childhood and adolescent years, the computer was an escape--a portal I could submerse myself in when things got too hard. From my early years, I joined underground communities, dabbled in illicit technologies, and became adept at exploring this machine that was all my own. I read news on Wired about evolving forms of technology, and I spent all my money not on clothes but on new gadgets. 

When I was thirteen or fourteen, I built my own personal computer. Things, at that time, also started failing. My monitor wiped out, and since my family couldn't afford a new one, I personally opened the screen up and soldered the failed nodes back to life. I was probably fourteen, and I protected my hands with a pair of socks I found, which was good because flecks of molten metal splattered on my hands from my inexperience. 

Whenever something failed, the computer's power unit, a flatscreen TV, even toilets, I opened it up and dissected it. Nothing was inscrutable, I thought, nothing was too hard to figure out. 

That's the thing I don't tell people. That underneath my artistic personality, but inherently intrinsic to it, there lies someone who's hopelessly curious about how the world works. 

## Next Steps 

In college, I went to a talk in the literary arts department. A pair of artists were presenting their work, though this time was different from the usual literature readings. 

Samantha Gorman and Danny Cannizzaro had both studied at Brown, working in the intersection of arts, literature, and technology. Together, they had created projects that investigated the ways in which art and technology can interact meaningfully . Samantha, for example, used the web for creative translation. She relied on crowdsourced help to produce a translated language of symbols that had its own unique semantic combinations and grammar, completely novel from its original work. 

The main work they presented was pry, a video game that also functioned as a book and movie. Fundamental to the app was the experience of haptic feedback, cinematic designs, and interactive feature. With simple touches, the user can "pry" into the inner world of the main character, where thought is construed as words, though quickly the user realizes that reading is a messy cohesion of meaning and chaos. The user then moves as the protagonist through two worlds, the internal, framed by narration, memories, and animation, and the external, the world of the day-to-day. As the game progresses, these worlds become increasingly intertwined, until the user can no longer simply access one or the other. 

While watching the talk, I was stunned. I felt astounded by the capacity of a knowledge I didn't know. 

I wanted to do that. I wanted to use technology in my art in a way that wasn't  shallow, but that was inherently intrinsic to what my art was saying and doing. I rarely liked art that used technology, because usually it felt contrived, as if it wasn't really necessary or meaningful. 

Years later, I'm still thinking about this talk, and how technology can aspire into art. 

## Now 

Learning to code isn't what I thought it would be. In many ways, I'm more suited to it than I thought I would be. There are times when I'm picking apart code, or putting it together, and the fineness of the details I have to take into account make me think of crocheting or knitting. It feels like the many nights where I pored over a page in my sketchbook, dutifully filling in a shadow or the mundane details of a background building. It's never a glamorous job, this sort of detailed, necessary work, but it offers up the satisfaction of progress. This page, this drawing, this site, is moving towards the finish, and each stroke--of the brush, of the key--brings us a little bit closer. It's a kind of work that I can get lost in, that I can spend all my nights doing happily.
