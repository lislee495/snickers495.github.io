Technology is full of fads, most of which are indecipherable for the general public. Terms like serverless technology and cloud computing mean nothing to most people, even if they're something we use almost everyday. But lately, with the meteoric rise and fall of Bitcoin's value, developers and laymen alike are going crazy over block chain-tech currency, as well as its potentially astronomical earning potential. 

But many people, despite hearing it all over the news, still _don't know what it is._

## What is Blockchain tech? 

Let's start with its origins: in 2008, an anonymous person by the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto published a paper outlining the design of bitcoin. By design, it's a trusted, shared, public ledger that is open to everyone, but controlled by no single person. The ledger consists of linked batches of transactions known as blocks, and a copy of each is stored on the computers that make up its network. Each change to the ledger is cryptographically signed to prove that the person changing the account actually owns the coins, and all the participants collectively keep it up to date. Essentially, once a transaction is recorded in the ledger, every node in the network is updated. 

Only a few months after the release of his essay, Satoshi then released the first software for bitcoin, as well as the first units of the currency, which were acquired through bitcoin mining. 

Bitcoin mining is how the bitcoin network is able to subsist online. People are paid in bitcoins to use their computers to "mine" for bitcoins, and provide the computational power to support the entire network. Each computer attempts to solve computationally difficult puzzles and compiles recent transactions into blocks. Those who solve the puzzle first places the next block on the block chain, and gets the  fees associated with the transaction as well as the newly released bitcoin. A constant amount of bitcoins are created when the puzzle is solved, and the difficulty of the puzzles are dependent on how many computers are mining in the network.

Bitcoin ledgers store the transactions, but they don't implicate the parties involved. This leaves users able to spend their bitcoins on potentially illicit transactions, like buying drugs on the Silk Road. 

## What's all the hype about? 

The main goal of Bitcoin was to keep track of how each unit of the currency is spent and prevent unauthorized changes to the ledger. Its biggest selling point is that when coded correctly, it provides a database that cannot be tampered with.  Its broader implications mean that it can potentially replace central banks, while a decentralized, cryptographically secure databse would allow for apps that cannot be censored and can work outside of giants like Facebook or Google. 

Companies have already started experimenting with different uses of blockchain tech outside of currency. For example, the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation have started experimenting with blockchain tech to improve the efficiency of stock trades.  Land registries and art ownership registries have also been explored. 

Essentially, any kind of field that relies on trust and centrally stored records, like the government or banks, are liable to be disrupted by blockchain tech. It can even spread to the realm of people's digital identities, which with blockchain tech can be tied to a token on a blockchain. 

## The "...but" part

For all its benefits, there are drawbacks to blockchain tech. For one, it's incredibly energy-intensive, with all of Bitcoin's mining computers requiring in energy the equivalent of a medium-sized country each day. Another cryptocurrency, Ethereum, requires another country's worth. 

The problem with these energy-requirements is that as it stands, Bitcoin isn't scalable without adjustments to how it's mined. 

Another big issue is that while coded-correctly, it's untamperable, when it's not, it's just as insecure as any other tech. In 2016, a hacker made off with $50 million of Ethereum due to a coding error. 

And while Bitcoin is often in the news for its rocketing and falling prices, this kind of volatility means that it's strayed from its original goal of existing as an accepted and widely-used currency. Rather, users are more inclined to hoard bitcoins as investments, pumping and dumping them to make large profits. And when its value can jump up hundreds of dollars in a matter of seconds, it decreases its feasibility as a kind of widely-used currency that people can use in their everyday transactions, like buying a cup of coffee. 

Right now, the value of Bitcoin is speculative, based more on investors jumping in to make a profit, than its true value as a game-changing technology.
