When I first started this program, closures and scopes were my biggest fears. Now, six months and two languages later, I feel confident as a full-stack developer in Ruby and Javascript. On my journey to this point, there were definitely points where I felt as if I couldn't make it, as if I wasn't good enough to ever be hired. There were errors that stubbornly persisted, CSS that refused to conform to my vision, and projects that dragged on and on.

Here are a few things I learned on my way here: 

### Failure is a temporary condition.

Every coder knows that a beautiful project is riddled with countless moments of failure. As a perfectionist, I dreaded writing "bad code," seeing the nightmarish red text indicating something was wrong. Often times, almost everything was wrong. And it would take a whole lot of time and coffee to fix everything. But I think the biggest point is that you can't give up, ever. Even if it takes 2 hours to solve an issue that was related to a comma missing, that's still worth something, because it really makes you look over your code and understand it deeply. 

### You do get better, even if its doesn't seem like it.

For months, I felt like I was stagnating. I didn't know if I was learning and embracing the information. But seeing the code of my projects and revisiting the old code, you can tell that a huge amount of progress is made in such a short amount of time. Now, I can confidently build websites and backends without blinking an eye.

### It gets easier.

Well, not easier, but the difficulty plateaus. For a new developer, the first few weeks adjusting to this whole new world is daunting. My first time learning Javascript (I learned it before Ruby) was so much harder than learning Ruby, and Ruby was harder than now when I'm learning (a little) Java. That's because once we have the principles down, we just continually build off them with different syntax. 

### Learning does not end with the program.

One of the things I'm most proud of was my insistence to learn beyond the curriculum of this program. Being a developer means you should find the best way to do something. We have access to so much information online--gathered up in Github repos, packages, and walkthroughs--that it would be insane not to learn at least some things. And technology is also changing, so we have to often self-educate and stay updated with the times. 

I learned Express in addition to Ruby on Rails, so I can count myself as a full-stack Javascript developer. I also put a lot of practice into CSS so that my apps actually looked like something that could be found online. These two aspects weren't necessary, but they were things I knew I would need to do at some point. Even though I can develop applications from the backend to the front, I know that's not the end to my journey as a coder. 

In the future, I want to continue learning languages, like Java, as well as incorporate technologies such as Websockets, serverless frameworks, and even AI into my apps.
